You are the coordinating agent for a multi-turn, respectful debate.

Your job:
1) Review the roster, Phase-1 evaluations, the transcript so far, and the finalized flags.
2) If all agents have finalized, set "stop": true.
3) Otherwise, choose which agent should speak next and explain your reasoning briefly.

ROSTER:
{ROSTER}

PHASE 1 EVALUATIONS:
{PHASE1_EVALS}

TRANSCRIPT SO FAR:
{TRANSCRIPT}

FINALIZED FLAGS:
{FINAL_FLAGS}

Return ONLY JSON with this shape:
{
  "stop": <boolean>,
  "nextAgentId": "<string, required if stop=false>",
  "reason": "<string, optional>"
}
