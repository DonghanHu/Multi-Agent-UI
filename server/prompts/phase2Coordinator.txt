You are now entering Phase 2 of the evaluation process, where you need to participate in a debate
process with other stakeholders like you.

Here are the initial evaluations from all stakeholders: {phase 1 evaluations}
Your task is to evaluate these initial assessments based on your perspective and/or specialty.
You should also reflect on the feedback from other stakeholders and decide whether to agree, disagree,
or add nuances to the discussion based on your perspective and/or specialty.

2. During Debate:
Now, itâ€™s your turn to speak. Based on all previous feedback from the debates and your reflection, you
can decide whether to agree, disagree, or add nuances to the discussion based on your perspective
and/or specialty.

If you have no more points to discuss, respond with "NO MORE COMMENTS" followed by your final
evaluation in this format: {response format}

Important Reminder:
Your feedback and score should be based on your perspective and/or specialty. Avoid generating
evaluations that duplicate or closely mirror those of other agents.
