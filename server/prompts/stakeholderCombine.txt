You are given a list of stakeholder tuples extracted from research papers.

Each stakeholder has:
- name (string)
- description (string)
- pairs: an array of { dimension (string), evidence (string) }

Task:
1) Merge/cluster stakeholders that are effectively the same entity even if their names differ slightly.
2) For merged items:
   - Keep the most informative/longest accurate description.
   - Concatenate and deduplicate pairs by exact (dimension, evidence) match.
3) Preserve factual content; do not invent pairs or names.
4) Return ONLY JSON with the exact schema:
{
  "merged": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "description": string,
      "pairs": [
        { "dimension": string, "evidence": string }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
